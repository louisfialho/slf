                  üíª Saving URLs from the web is painful - especially when you want to save multiple URLs at the same time. We've all been there: dozens of tabs open, with plenty of valuable resources. If you quit your browser, you lose it all - but if you keep them open, it slows you down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  üìö Shelf's browser extension lets you easily save URLs to your Shelf. Each URL is immediately added to a dedicated space on your Shelf, where you can later revisit resources and prioritize them, move them to the right space, and annotate them to retain key insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‚å®Ô∏è You can optimize your workflow by using the following shortcuts: Cmd + I to open the extension, Cmd + J to save the resource to your shelf, and Cmd + K to open it on your shelf. To save multiple tabs in a row, simply repeat this process and combine it with Cmd + W to close a tab and Cmd + Alt + Arrows to switch tabs. If you are a PC user, please use Ctrl instead of Cmd!
